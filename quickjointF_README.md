# Quickjoint
-----
Version 2021.1
For inkscape V 1.x
-----

This is an Inkscape extension to help rapidly prototype 3D assemblies using a laser cutter, CNC router, waterjet cutter, or similar 2D process.

It can quickly add box tabs to selected lines, or matching slots using guidelines.

Please see the attached link for better documentation and updated files! I can't promise this page will stay up-to-date.

The kerf was not correctly adjusted, so I modified this extension.
The original extension is here : https://inkscape.org/~Jarrett/%E2%98%85quickjoint

Usage
-----

Restart inkscape.

The table will be available under "Extensions > DÃ©coupe Laser > Assemblage rapide".
