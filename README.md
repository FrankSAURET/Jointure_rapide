QuickJoint
================


## What's this?


This is an Inkscape extension to help rapidly prototype 3D assemblies using a laser cutter, CNC router, waterjet cutter, or similar 2D process.

It can quickly add box tabs to objects.

Target material size and other mechanical properties are configurable.

Mating slots can be generating using a path as a guide.

## Installation

Copy the two main files, `quickjoint.inx` and `quickjoint.py` into your `Inkscape/share/extensions folder`, where-ever that is. Mine is in `C:\Program Files`.

This probably requires Inkscape 0.91 or newer. There were some great changes in the last couple versions, old copies of Inkscape should be upgraded regardless!


## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests welcome. This is a pretty small side project so I don't expect a whole lot to change, but incremental improvements are rad.
